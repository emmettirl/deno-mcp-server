### Migration Guide

If upgrading from a pre-1.0 version:

1. Update your `deno.json` configuration to use the new schema
2. Review your permission requirements (now optimized per tool)
3. Update any custom tool integrations to use the new modular architecture
4. Run the security tests to validate your configuration

### Known Issues

- None at this time

### Future Roadmap
