# Analysis Documentation Index

This directory contains our systematic analysis of the GitHub MCP server implementation compared to our Deno-based approach.

## üìÅ Structure

### Core Analysis Documents

- **[Analysis Plan](analysis-plan.md)** - Comprehensive plan for systematic comparison
- **[Architecture Comparison](architecture-comparison.md)** - High-level architectural decisions and patterns
- **[MCP Implementation Analysis](mcp-implementation-analysis.md)** - Protocol implementation details
- **[Tool Patterns Comparison](tool-patterns-comparison.md)** - Tool design and execution patterns
- **[Testing Strategies Analysis](testing-strategies-analysis.md)** - Testing approaches and frameworks

### Supporting Materials

- **[Code Samples](code-samples/)** - Extracted code examples for reference
- **[Decision Matrix](decision-matrix/)** - Structured decision frameworks
- **[Recommendations](recommendations/)** - Prioritized improvement suggestions

## üéØ Analysis Goals

1. **Learn from GitHub's implementation** - Understand their architectural decisions and patterns
2. **Identify improvement opportunities** - Find areas where we can enhance our implementation
3. **Make informed decisions** - Use data to guide future development choices
4. **Align with ecosystem standards** - Ensure our approach follows MCP best practices

## üìä Progress Tracking

- [ ] Phase 1: Architecture & Structure Analysis
- [ ] Phase 2: MCP Protocol Implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Development Experience
- [ ] Phase 4: Operational Aspects

## üîç Key Questions

- Which architectural approach provides better maintainability?
- How do the different technology stacks compare in practice?
- What can we learn about MCP tool implementation patterns?
- How do testing strategies and development workflows compare?
- Which deployment and operational approaches are most effective?
