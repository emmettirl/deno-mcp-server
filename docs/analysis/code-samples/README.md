# Code Samples from GitHub MCP Server

This directory contains extracted code examples from the GitHub MCP server for analysis and comparison.

## 📁 Organization

### By Component

- `transport/` - Transport layer implementation examples
- `tools/` - Tool implementation patterns
- `protocol/` - MCP protocol handling examples
- `config/` - Configuration management patterns

## 🎯 Purpose

These code samples serve as:

1. **Reference implementations** for comparison with our approach
2. **Pattern examples** to understand their architectural decisions
3. **Learning materials** for potential improvements to our codebase
4. **Documentation support** for analysis documents
