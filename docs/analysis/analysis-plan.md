- What are the performance trade-offs?
- Which provides better developer experience?

### 2. Tool Implementation

**Our Tools**: deno_fmt, deno_lint, deno_check, deno_test, deno_run, deno_info
**GitHub Tools**: TBD (need to analyze)

**Analysis Questions**:

- How do tool definition patterns compare?
- Which approach provides better extensibility?
- How do error handling strategies differ?
- What can we learn about tool organization?

### 3. Configuration Management

**Our Approach**: VS Code settings integration
**GitHub Approach**: TBD (need to analyze)

**Analysis Questions**:

- How do configuration paradigms compare?
- Which provides better user experience?
- What are the security implications?
- How do validation approaches differ?

### 4. Testing Strategies

**Our Approach**: 140+ tests with VS Code integration testing
**GitHub Approach**: TBD (need to analyze)

**Analysis Questions**:

- How do testing frameworks compare?
- Which provides better coverage strategies?
- What can we learn about integration testing?
- How do CI/CD approaches differ?

## üìä Analysis Methodology

- `mcp-implementation-analysis.md` - Protocol implementation details
- `tool-patterns-comparison.md` - Tool design and execution patterns
- `testing-strategies-analysis.md` - Testing approaches and frameworks
- `deployment-comparison.md` - Distribution and operational aspects

### Supporting Documentation

- `code-samples/` - Extracted code examples for reference
- `decision-matrix/` - Structured decision frameworks
- `recommendations/` - Prioritized improvement suggestions

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Immediate Outcomes

- [ ] Comprehensive understanding of GitHub's MCP implementation
