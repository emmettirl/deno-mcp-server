# Tool Patterns Comparison

## üìã Overview

Analysis of how tools are designed, implemented, and executed in both MCP server implementations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Current Tool Set

### Deno Development Tools

- **deno_fmt** - Code formatting
- **deno_lint** - Linting and code quality
- **deno_check** - Type checking without emission
- **deno_test** - Test execution
- **deno_run** - Script execution with permissions
- **deno_info** - Dependency and module information

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Our tool implementation pattern
interface DenoTool {
  execute(params: ToolParams): Promise<ToolResult>;
  validate(params: ToolParams): ValidationResult;
  getSchema(): ToolSchema;
}
```

## üîç GitHub Tool Analysis
