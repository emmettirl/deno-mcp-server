# Developer Experience Analysis

## üìã Overview

Comparing developer experience, tooling, and ecosystem integration between GitHub's and our MCP server implementations.

## üîç Analysis Status: Phase 4

_This file will be populated during Week 4 of analysis_

## Development Tooling

### Build & Development Process

**TO ANALYZE**:

- GitHub's Go build pipeline and tooling
- Development workflow and hot reload
- Testing and validation pipeline
- Docker integration and containerization

### Code Organization

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Package structure and dependency management
- Interface definitions and abstractions
- Configuration management patterns
- Error handling and logging strategies

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Strategy

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Unit test coverage and patterns
- Integration test approaches
- End-to-end testing strategies
- Mock and fixture management

### Code Quality

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Linting and formatting standards
- Code review processes
- Documentation standards
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Documentation & Onboarding

### Developer Documentation

**TO ANALYZE**:

- API documentation quality
- Setup and getting started guides
- Architecture decision records
- Troubleshooting guides

### Community Aspects

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Contribution guidelines
- Issue templates and management
- Community engagement patterns

## Our Current Approach

### Development Tooling

- Deno's built-in tooling (fmt, lint, test, check)
- VS Code extension for integration
- PowerShell build scripts
- Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Testing & Quality

- 140+ unit tests across packages
- Integration testing for VS Code extension
- Type checking with TypeScript strict mode
- Manual testing and validation

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README files
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Copilot instructions for AI assistance
- Architecture and API documentation
