# Security & Performance Analysis

## üìã Overview

Analyzing security implementations and performance optimization strategies in GitHub's MCP server.

## üîç Analysis Status: Phase 3

_This file will be populated during Week 3 of analysis_

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

**TO ANALYZE**:

- OAuth implementation patterns
- PAT handling and validation
- Permission scoping and validation

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**TO ANALYZE**:

- How GitHub validates and sanitizes user inputs
- Protection against injection attacks
- Safe handling of GitHub API data

### Resource Protection

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Rate limiting implementation
- Resource usage controls
- DoS protection strategies

## Performance Optimization

### GitHub API Efficiency

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Caching strategies for GitHub API responses
- Batch operation patterns
- Connection pooling and reuse

### Memory & Resource Management

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Go garbage collection considerations
- Memory usage patterns
- Resource cleanup strategies

### Concurrent Processing

**TO ANALYZE**:

- Goroutine usage patterns
- Concurrent API calls
- Lock-free programming techniques

## Our Current Approach

### Security

- Basic input validation in tool implementations
- Deno's security model with explicit permissions
- No authentication layer (local-only tools)

### Performance

- Simple sequential command execution
- Basic error handling without retries
- No caching or optimization strategies

## Comparison Areas

- [ ] Authentication and authorization patterns
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization strategies
- [ ] Rate limiting and resource protection
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Monitoring and observability approaches
