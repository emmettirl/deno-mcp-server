## 🔍 Analysis Methodology

### Step 1: Code Structure Analysis

For each area, we'll examine:

1. **File organization**: How code is structured and organized
2. **Design patterns**: Architectural patterns and best practices used
3. **Implementation details**: Specific implementation choices and rationales

### Step 2: Comparative Analysis

For each finding:

1. **Document GitHub's approach**: What they did and how
2. **Document our approach**: What we did and how
3. **Compare trade-offs**: Pros and cons of each approach
4. **Identify improvements**: What we could adopt or adapt

### Step 3: Recommendations

For each area:

1. **Keep**: What we're doing well that should be maintained
2. **Adopt**: What we should implement from GitHub's approach
3. **Adapt**: What we should modify based on their patterns
4. **Avoid**: What we should specifically not do
