# Tool Organization & Structure Comparison

## 📋 Overview

Comparing how tools are organized, implemented, and managed between GitHub's approach and our Deno implementation.

## 🔍 Analysis Status: Phase 2

_This file will be populated during Week 2 of analysis_

## GitHub's Toolset Approach

### Package Structure

Based on initial analysis of `pkg/toolsets/`:

- **TO ANALYZE**: How tools are categorized and grouped
- **TO ANALYZE**: Tool discovery and registration patterns
- **TO ANALYZE**: Configuration and parameterization strategies

### Tool Implementation Patterns

**TO ANALYZE**: Common patterns used across different tool implementations

## Our Tool Structure

### Current Organization

```
packages/server/src/tools/
├── index.ts     # Tool exports and registration
├── fmt.ts       # Deno formatting tool
├── lint.ts      # Deno linting tool
├── check.ts     # Deno type checking tool
├── test.ts      # Deno testing tool
├── run.ts       # Deno script execution tool
└── info.ts      # Deno info tool
```

### Implementation Pattern

- Simple async functions with consistent signatures
- Direct Deno CLI command execution via `Deno.Command`
- Basic error handling and output formatting

## Comparison Areas

- [ ] Tool categorization and organization strategies
- [ ] Implementation patterns and consistency
- [ ] Configuration and parameter handling
- [ ] Error handling and validation approaches
- [ ] Testing strategies for individual tools
