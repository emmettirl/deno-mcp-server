## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Framework Template

For each major decision area, we use:

### 1. Decision Context

- What decision needs to be made?
- Why is this decision important?
- What are the constraints and requirements?

### 2. Options Analysis

- Option A: GitHub's approach
  - Pros, Cons, Trade-offs
- Option B: Our current approach
  - Pros, Cons, Trade-offs
- Option C: Hybrid or alternative approach
  - Pros, Cons, Trade-offs

### 3. Evaluation Criteria

- Maintainability
- Performance
- Developer Experience
- Scalability
- Security
- Community Alignment

### 4. Recommendation

- Preferred approach with rationale
- Implementation considerations
- Migration strategy if needed
