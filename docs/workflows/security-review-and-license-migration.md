# Security Review and MIT License Migration

## Summary

This document outlines the security review performed on the Deno MCP Server repository and the migration from a proprietary license to MIT License.

## Changes Made

### 1. License Change

- **File**: `LICENSE`
- **Change**: Converted from proprietary "All Rights Reserved" license to MIT License
- **Impact**: The project is now open source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed

### 2. Repository URL Placeholders Fixed

- **File**: `README.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced all instances of `your-username` with `emmettirl`
  - Updated GitHub URLs from placeholder to actual repository: `https://github.com/emmettirl/deno-mcp-server`
  - Fixed Docker registry URLs: `ghcr.io/emmettirl/deno-mcp-server/server`
  - Updated git clone URL to actual repository

## Security Review Findings

### ‚úÖ No Sensitive Information Found

The review searched for common patterns of sensitive information and found:

1. **No hardcoded credentials**: No passwords, API keys, tokens, or secrets
2. **No personal paths**: No hardcoded user directories or personal file paths
3. **No private IP addresses**: Only appropriate localhost references for development
4. **No email addresses**: No personal email addresses exposed
5. **No environment variables**: No sensitive environment configuration exposed

### üìù Appropriate References Found

The following references are legitimate and safe:

- `localhost` references in development configuration (appropriate for local development)
- Package version numbers and dependency references
- Test file references to mock "secrets.txt" (used only for security testing, not real secrets)

## Repository Safety Assessment

### ‚úÖ Safe to Make Public

Based on this review, the repository can safely be made public because:

1. **No credentials exposed**: No API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens
2. **No personal information**: No personal email addresses or private details
3. **No sensitive paths**: No hardcoded file system paths that reveal system information
4. **MIT Licensed**: Now properly licensed for open source distribution
5. **Professional structure**: Well-organized codebase suitable for public consumption

### üîß Configuration Notes

- VS Code extension uses proper authentication flows (GitHub OAuth) rather than hardcoded tokens
- MCP server uses permission-based security model without hardcoded credentials
- Docker and GitHub Actions configurations use standard practices

## Post-Migration Recommendations

1. **Update Documentation**: All placeholder URLs have been updated to actual repository URLs
2. **GitHub Repository**: Can be safely switched from private to public
3. **Release Strategy**: Automated releases are configured and ready for public distribution
4. **Community Guidelines**: Consider adding CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for open source community
