# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Overview

Reorganized all documentation files into a structured directory hierarchy within `docs/` for better organization and discoverability.

## Changes Made

### 🏗️ **New Directory Structure Created**

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation index and navigation
├── development/                 # Technical documentation
│   ├── api.md                  # (moved from docs/api.md)
│   ├── security.md             # (moved from docs/security.md)
│   └── build.md                # (moved from BUILD.md)
├── guides/                      # User-facing guides
│   ├── project-wide-operations.md  # (moved from docs/PROJECT_WIDE_OPERATIONS.md)
│   └── examples.md             # (moved from docs/examples.md)
├── fixes/                       # Bug fix documentation
│   ├── mcp-workspace-fix.md    # (moved from MCP_WORKSPACE_FIX.md)
│   └── line-ending-fix.md      # (moved from docs/LINE_ENDING_FIX.md)
└── workflows/                   # Development workflow reports
    ├── tool-enhancements.md    # (moved from TOOL_ENHANCEMENTS.md)
    ├── publisher-update.md     # (moved from PUBLISHER_UPDATE.md)
    ├── cleanup-plan.md         # (moved from docs/cleanup-plan.md)
    ├── issue-4-cleanup.md      # (merged from docs/ISSUE_4_CLEANUP.md + docs/issue-4-cleanup.md)
    └── issue-5-large-file-refactoring.md  # (moved from docs/issue-5-large-file-refactoring.md)
```

### 📁 **Files Moved and Renamed**

- Used kebab-case naming convention consistently
- Moved all workflow and report files from root to appropriate subdirectories
- Consolidated duplicate files (removed `issue-4-cleanup-duplicate.md`)
- Removed temporary files (`fix-mcp-config.ps1`)

### 📝 **Documentation Updated**

1. **`docs/README.md`** - Completely rewritten with:
   - Clear directory structure overview
   - Quick navigation links for different user types
   - File naming conventions
   - Contributing guidelines

2. **Main `README.md`** - Updated documentation section with:
   - Organized links by user type (Users, Developers, Contributors)
   - Clear descriptions for each document
   - Proper links to new file locations

### 🎯 **Benefits**

- **Better Organization**: Related documents are grouped logically
- **Easier Navigation**: Clear directory structure with descriptive names
- **Improved Discoverability**: Users can quickly find relevant documentation
- **Consistent Naming**: All files use kebab-case for better readability
- **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory is cleaner with workflow docs moved to appropriate locations
- **Future-Proof**: Scalable structure that can accommodate new documentation

### 🔗 **Updated References**

All internal links and references have been updated to reflect the new file locations in:

- Main README.md
- Documentation index (docs/README.md)
- Package-specific documentation links

## File Naming Convention Established

- **Format**: `kebab-case.md`
- **Examples**:
  - `project-wide-operations.md` (instead of `PROJECT_WIDE_OPERATIONS.md`)
  - `mcp-workspace-fix.md` (instead of `MCP_WORKSPACE_FIX.md`)
  - `tool-enhancements.md` (instead of `TOOL_ENHANCEMENTS.md`)

## Categories Defined

1. **development/** - Technical docs for contributors and maintainers
2. **guides/** - User-facing tutorials and how-to guides
3. **fixes/** - Documentation of bug fixes and resolutions
4. **workflows/** - Development process documentation and change reports

This reorganization provides a much cleaner and more professional documentation structure that scales well as the project grows.
